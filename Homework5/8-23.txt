Signals cannot be used to count events in other processes because signals are not queued. When the first signal is sent to parent process, it will call function handler. Thereafter, while the handler is still processing the first signal, the third signal arrives. Since there is already a pending SIGCHLD, this third SIGCHLD signal is discarded. So are the forth and fifth SIGCHLD signals.
