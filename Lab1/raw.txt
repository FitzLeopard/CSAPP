In the article, the author says that Sinosauropteryx was not a feathered dinosaur. But the professor thinks three reasons which are given by the reading part is no  convincing.

First of all, the passage believes that fine lines might form after the dinosaur die, and not come from functional structures of a living dinosaur. However, the professor disagrees with that. The professor points out that we could not find other animal fossils buried in the same place have the fine lines and they are well preserved, which shows that lines were not fibers caused by the decomposition but feathers.

In addition, the professor thinks that there are some chemical differences between feathers and frills, because feathers have a kind of proteins which frills do not contain, and scientists find that Sinosauropteryx structure had this protein, which directly refutes what the reading states that the fine lines might be the remains of dinosaurs frills.

What's more, the article says that feathers were used to help animals fly or keep their temperature, but the location of the structure shows that it did not have the function. But  the professor agrees that feathers are used for finding mate. For example, a kind of birds uses feathers in its tails to attract mates . And scientists find the feathers of the dinosaurs are orange and white, which shows that it is used for display.

In the article, the author gives three theories about the functions of carved stone balls which were found in Scotland, dating from late Neolithic period. But in the listening part, the professor says that the three theories are not convincing.

First of all, the professor thinks the carved stone balls are not wear or damage , because if they are used for hunting or fighting, they can break into pieces easily,  which directly refutes what the passages states that carved stone balls are weapons used in hunting or fighting.

In addition, the reading parts believes that the carved stone balls were used for weights and measures, because the sizes of them are the same. But the professor disagrees with that. The professor points out that we find that the carved stone balls had different types. So, the weights of the stone balls are not the same though they are in a same size, which means they are not used for measuring.

What's more, the reading thinks that these carved stones can serve a social purpose as opposed to a practical or utilitarian one. But the professor says the patterns in these stone balls are too simple to be a signal of social level. Also, as we all know, if a high-ranking people  in Neolithic die , other people should bury him with something which could show he was a  important man. But we cannot find any carved stone balls in tombs.

In the article, the author gives three theories that can explain why sea cows die out. However, in the reading part, the professor points out the three reasons all are wrong below .

First of all, the passage thinks that the extinction of sea cows might be caused by the overhunting of native Siberian people. But the professor disagrees with that. The professor believes that sea cows are really massive creatures and the population of native Siberian people is not a huge number . As a result, if native people just want to feed themselves with sea cows, they needn't hunt sea cows a lot.

In addition, the passage states that ecosystems disturbances might result in the decline of sea cow population. But the professor says that if these  happened, other sea creatures such as whales would be in a decline, too. However, there is no evidence which proves it, and we could find that sea cows do not face a food shortage.

What's more, the reading part agrees that European fur traders who came to this island might make sea cows die out . But the professor thinks that the sea cow population has been already decreasing in  1700, just before European fur traders came.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The rules that the whole societies today expect to young people to follow and obey are too strict.
In the modern world, plenty of young people start to try their best to realize their dream. Without ignoring this , many people think that the rules that the whole societies today expect to young people to follow and obey is necessary. However, some strict rules even block the youth development, which is harmful to the young people and the whole societies. Therefore, I hold the view that the rules that the whole societies today expect to young people to follow and obey are too strict.

To start with, young people are well educated, so it is not necessary to set the strict rules for young people. Nowadays, compulsory education is successfully implement  in more and more countries, which leads to the quality of young people growing . Consequently, if we still use  these old and unreasonable rules, visible or invisible, to tell young people what they should do and what they should not, it will cause  a waste of time. In fact, most social administrators and government officials have been aware that there is no need to require the young to live up to strict standards. Instead, they believe and encourage the young, so that these young people can make great contribution to the development of a country. So, if we trust young people and give them freedom to do what they want, it will be beneficial to us. 


In addition, young people are the main force to the development of the whole societies. So, the whole societies development should ask the government not to set rules to constrain young people but give them more spaces . [For instance, in my country, many young people start to establish their own corporations just after they graduate from university. Also, a great number of companies begin to aim at young people marketing. As a result, we cannot ignore these young people, who can change the consumer market. ]So, give  them more freedom is indispensable.

What¡¯s more, in today¡¯s globalization environment, different ideas in fusion, will promote social to give more freedom to young people. As we all know, the modern world is convenient for everyone to communicate. And young people can learn the new technology faster than old, so they can study how to use the Internet and smart phones. Thus, young people could make the societies to admit them easily.

In conclusion, the government should give  young people more free space to keep the development of the country in a high speed, instead of setting strict rules for them.(360 words)
