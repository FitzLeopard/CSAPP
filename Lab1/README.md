# Overview
* **Count_Words.c** is the main program, and it will be open source after the deadline of Lab1.
* **Solution.pdf** is my solution to Lab1.
* **raw.txt** is a book written by J. K. Rowling, *Harry Potter*. The whole file is too big( 6MB), so I didn't update it. You can get the file from [elearning](http://elearning.fudan.edu.cn/access/content/group/711575ab-d720-4e50-b037-95c97b2fefe1/%E5%93%88%E5%88%A9%E6%B3%A2%E7%89%B9%E5%85%A8%E9%9B%86_%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88_.txt).
* **result.txt** is the result of my program.
* **compare.bat** can help you compare whether your result is different from mine. You should name your result **my.txt**, and then double-click the file **compare.bat**.( Only in windows system)
