the
author
says
that
sinosauropteryx
was
not
a
feathered
dinosaur
but
the
professor
thinks
three
reasons
which
are
given
by
the
reading
part
is
no
convincing
first
of
all
the
passage
believes
that
fine
lines
might
form
after
the
dinosaur
die
and
not
come
from
functional
structures
of
a
living
dinosaur
however
the
professor
disagrees
with
that
the
professor
points
out
that
we
could
not
find
other
animal
fossils
buried
in
the
same
place
have
the
fine
lines
and
they
are
well
preserved
which
shows
that
lines
were
not
fibers
caused
by
the
decomposition
but
feathers
in
addition
the
professor
thinks
that
there
are
some
chemical
differences
between
feathers
and
frills
because
feathers
have
a
kind
of
proteins
which
frills
do
not
contain
and
scientists
find
that
sinosauropteryx
structure
had
this
protein
which
directly
refutes
what
the
reading
states
that
the
fine
lines
might
be
the
remains
of
dinosaurs
frills
what's
more
the
article
says
that
feathers
were
used
to
help
animals
fly
or
keep
their
temperature
but
the
location
of
the
structure
shows
that
it
did
not
have
the
function
but
the
professor
agrees
that
feathers
are
used
for
finding
mate
for
example
a
kind
of
birds
uses
feathers
in
its
tails
to
attract
mates
and
scientists
find
the
feathers
of
the
dinosaurs
are
orange
and
white
which
shows
that
it
is
used
for
display
tpo
integrated
writing
in
the
article
the
author
gives
three
theories
about
the
functions
of
carved
stone
balls
which
were
found
in
scotland
dating
from
late
neolithic
period
but
in
the
listening
part
the
professor
says
that
the
three
theories
are
not
convincing
first
of
all
the
professor
thinks
the
carved
stone
balls
are
not
wear
or
damage
because
if
they
are
used
for
hunting
or
fighting
they
can
break
into
pieces
easily
which
directly
refutes
what
the
passages
states
that
carved
stone
balls
are
weapons
used
in
hunting
or
fighting
in
addition
the
reading
parts
believes
that
the
carved
stone
balls
were
used
for
weights
and
measures
because
the
sizes
of
them
are
the
same
but
the
professor
disagrees
with
that
the
professor
points
out
that
we
find
that
the
carved
stone
balls
had
different
types
so
the
weights
of
the
stone
balls
are
not
the
same
though
they
are
in
a
same
size
which
means
they
are
not
used
for
measuring
what's
more
the
reading
thinks
that
these
carved
stones
can
serve
a
social
purpose
as
opposed
to
a
practical
or
utilitarian
one
but
the
professor
says
the
patterns
in
these
stone
balls
are
too
simple
to
be
a
signal
of
social
level
also
as
we
all
know
if
a
high
ranking
people
in
neolithic
die
other
people
should
bury
him
with
something
which
could
show
he
was
a
important
man
but
we
cannot
find
any
carved
stone
balls
in
tombs
tpo
integrated
writing
in
the
article
the
author
gives
three
theories
that
can
explain
why
sea
cows
die
out
however
in
the
reading
part
the
professor
points
out
the
three
reasons
all
are
wrong
below
first
of
all
the
passage
thinks
that
the
extinction
of
sea
cows
might
be
caused
by
the
overhunting
of
native
siberian
people
but
the
professor
disagrees
with
that
the
professor
believes
that
sea
cows
are
really
massive
creatures
and
the
population
of
native
siberian
people
is
not
a
huge
number
as
a
result
if
native
people
just
want
to
feed
themselves
with
sea
cows
they
needn't
hunt
sea
cows
a
lot
in
addition
the
passage
states
that
ecosystems
disturbances
might
result
in
the
decline
of
sea
cow
population
but
the
professor
says
that
if
these
happened
other
sea
creatures
such
as
whales
would
be
in
a
decline
too
however
there
is
no
evidence
which
proves
it
and
we
could
find
that
sea
cows
do
not
face
a
food
shortage
what's
more
the
reading
part
agrees
that
european
fur
traders
who
came
to
this
island
might
make
sea
cows
die
out
but
the
professor
thinks
that
the
sea
cow
population
has
been
already
decreasing
in
just
before
european
fur
traders
came
the
structure
is
clear
and
details
are
generally
complete
and
accurate
which
is
good
if
you
can
avoid
the
vagueness
of
some
sentences
your
essay
will
be
better
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
following
statement
the
rules
that
the
whole
societies
today
expect
to
young
people
to
follow
and
obey
are
too
strict
in
the
modern
world
plenty
of
young
people
start
to
try
their
best
to
realize
their
dream
without
ignoring
this
many
people
think
that
the
rules
that
the
whole
societies
today
expect
to
young
people
to
follow
and
obey
is
necessary
however
some
strict
rules
even
block
the
youth
development
which
is
harmful
to
the
young
people
and
the
whole
societies
therefore
i
hold
the
view
that
the
rules
that
the
whole
societies
today
expect
to
young
people
to
follow
and
obey
are
too
strict
to
start
with
young
people
are
well
educated
so
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
the
strict
rules
for
young
people
nowadays
compulsory
education
is
successfully
implement
in
more
and
more
countries
which
leads
to
the
quality
of
young
people
growing
consequently
if
we
still
use
these
old
and
unreasonable
rules
visible
or
invisible
to
tell
young
people
what
they
should
do
and
what
they
should
not
it
will
cause
a
waste
of
time
in
fact
most
social
administrators
and
government
officials
have
been
aware
that
there
is
no
need
to
require
the
young
to
live
up
to
strict
standards
instead
they
believe
and
encourage
the
young
so
that
these
young
people
can
make
great
contribution
to
the
development
of
a
country
so
if
we
trust
young
people
and
give
them
freedom
to
do
what
they
want
it
will
be
beneficial
to
us
in
addition
young
people
are
the
main
force
to
the
development
of
the
whole
societies
so
the
whole
societies
development
should
ask
the
government
not
to
set
rules
to
constrain
young
people
but
give
them
more
spaces
for
instance
in
my
country
many
young
people
start
to
establish
their
own
corporations
just
after
they
graduate
from
university
also
a
great
number
of
companies
begin
to
aim
at
young
people
marketing
as
a
result
we
cannot
ignore
these
young
people
who
can
change
the
consumer
market
so
give
them
more
freedom
is
indispensable
what
s
more
in
today
s
globalization
environment
different
ideas
in
fusion
will
promote
social
to
give
more
freedom
to
young
people
as
we
all
know
the
modern
world
is
convenient
for
everyone
to
communicate
and
young
people
can
learn
the
new
technology
faster
than
old
so
they
can
study
how
to
use
the
internet
and
smart
phones
thus
young
people
could
make
the
societies
to
admit
them
easily
in
conclusion
the
government
should
give
young
people
more
free
space
to
keep
the
development
of
the
country
in
a
high
speed
instead
of
setting
strict
rules
for
them
words
the
first
point
is
good
logical
and
convincing
the
second
point
is
less
satisfactory
while
the
third
one
is
a
little
off
the
point
please
think
about
the
relevance
