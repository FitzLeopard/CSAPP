A. We can see that the program is performing multiprecision operations on
64-bit data. We can also see that the 64-bit multiply operation (line 4) uses
unsigned arithmetic, and so we conclude that num_t is unsigned long long.

B.
1 movl 12(%ebp), %eax Get x
2 movl 20(%ebp), %ecx Get y_h
3 imull %eax, %ecx Compute s = x*y_h
4 mull 16(%ebp) Compute t = x*y_l
5 leal (%ecx,%edx), %edx Add s to t_h
6 movl 8(%ebp), %ecx Get dest
7 movl %eax, (%ecx) Store t_l
8 movl %edx, 4(%ecx) Store s+t_h
